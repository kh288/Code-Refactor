# Code Refactor

Went through the netire page and cleaned up a couple things under the hood:

<ul>
<li>Fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link not working</li>

<li>Added Alt text for images</li>

<li>Added HTML Semantics to the page</li>

<li>Cleaned combined some redundent CSS Tags</li>
</ul>
